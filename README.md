real-time community alert system
Develop a web-based community alert system that enables users to
share real-time updates about local events, emergencies, or hazards. The platform
should feature a map interface where users can pin alerts, categorize them by type
(e.g., traffic, weather, safety), and receive notifications based on their location.
Include options for local authorities or community leaders to verify and manage
alerts
